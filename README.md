# LanguageLearnersUnitedOver9000
This is a school project in order to develop an application from the ground up.  The purpose of this project in addition to increasing our abilities to program, is to also help give those who wish to learn other langauges another outlet to do so.  This project has three main functional requirements.  A flash card game of top words from each language available, a way for users to see facts about their language of choice, and to have the ability to reach out to other learners like them and help learn together.  The students for this project and their contributions are the following:

- Michael Cottrell
